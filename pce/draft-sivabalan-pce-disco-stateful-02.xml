    <abstract>
      <t>When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating in IGP,
      its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised using IGP
      flooding. Such IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS. This document
      specifies two new PCE capabilities advertised by IGP.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element
      Protocol (PCEP), which defines the communication between a Path
      Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE
      and PCE, enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for
      Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics.</t>

      <t>Stateful PCE <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce"/> specifies a set
      of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
      across PCEP sessions in compliance with <xref target="RFC4657"/>.  It
      includes mechanisms to effect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and
      PCEs, delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
      sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions. It focuses
      on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and the LSP's path routing
      and the timing of its setup is delegated to the PCE.</t>

      <t>When PCCs are LSRs participating in the IGP (OSPF or IS-IS), and PCEs
      are either LSRs or servers also participating in the IGP, an effective
      mechanism for PCE discovery within an IGP routing domain consists of
      utilizing IGP advertisements. Such extension to OSPF to IS-IS exists in
      <xref target="RFC5088"/> and <xref target="RFC5089"/>, respectively.
      Currently, the IGP PCE capability does not indicate whether the advertised
      PCE is stateful. Advertising active and passive stateful PCE capabilities
      would facilitate a PCC to learn about available stateful PCEs, as well as
      about a PCE's capability to modify LSP parameters. A PCC could listen to
      IGP updates, or use other mechanisms that carry IGP information to
      interested clients, such as BGP-LS (<xref
      target="I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution"/>) where IGP PCE capability
      advertisements can be carried in the Opaque Prefix Attribute defined in
      Section 3.3.3.6. This document extends the IGP PCE capability
      advertisement mechanism to include active and passive stateful PCEs.</t>
